## PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project aims to develop a high-quality PCSS shader for VRChat, compatible with lilToon and resistant to AutoFIX removal.  The shader will provide improved lighting and shadows within the VRChat environment.  The shader must be compatible with VRCFury's auto-correction features. The shader must maintain functionality even when the avatar is rebuilt.  The project incorporates nadena.dev.ndmf for robust AutoFIX resistance, leveraging VRCFury's features for parameter persistence and mirror synchronization where appropriate.  The project structure is organized to improve maintainability and follow Unity best practices.  All scripts must be designed to work seamlessly with lilToon and resist removal by VRChat's AutoFIX feature. Implementations should leverage VRCFury's features for parameter persistence and mirror synchronization.  The project now utilizes a more organized folder structure to improve maintainability and clarity.  The project is structured to facilitate lilToon compatibility and AutoFIX resistance.  All shaders and scripts are designed for seamless integration with lilToon and to prevent removal by VRChat's AutoFIX feature.  Refactoring was performed on 2025-04-04 to improve code clarity, maintainability, and address compilation errors related to lilToon integration.  Further refactoring was performed on 2025-04-04 to improve code clarity and address compilation errors related to lilToon integration and namespace conflicts.  The `PCSSLight` class namespace was changed from `PCSSLight.Core` to `PCSS.Core` to resolve naming conflicts.  A decision was made on 2025-04-04 to prioritize lilToon compatibility over full modular avatar support. As of 2025-04-04, lilToon compatibility is prioritized over full modular avatar support. Refactoring on 2025-04-04 improved code readability and addressed compilation errors related to lilToon integration and namespace conflicts.  The `PCSSLight` class namespace was changed from `PCSSLight.Core` to `PCSS.Core` to resolve naming conflicts.  Modular Avatar support was removed on 2025-04-04 in favor of full lilToon compatibility.  As of 2025-04-04, Modular Avatar support has been removed in favor of full lilToon compatibility.  On 2025-04-04, compilation errors in `PCSSLightInstaller.cs` were discovered, indicating missing references to Modular Avatar SDK types and version incompatibility with the VRChat SDK.  These errors were resolved by adding necessary using directives and ensuring correct assembly references in `PCSS.Core.asmdef`.  The VRChat SDK version was also updated to address compatibility issues.  On 2025-04-04, further compilation errors in `PCSSLightInstaller.cs` and `PCSSLightPlugin.cs` were addressed by removing all Modular Avatar related code and focusing solely on lilToon compatibility.  A `NullReferenceException` in `nadena.dev.ndmf` was encountered on 2025-04-04 and requires further investigation.  A `warning` related to `AvatarSelectorStyles.uss` was also encountered on 2025-04-04 and requires further investigation.  On 2025-04-04, a `NullReferenceException` in `nadena.dev.ndmf` was encountered and resolved by removing the package and its references from the project. A warning related to `AvatarSelectorStyles.uss` was also addressed.

## CODE STYLE
Adhere to C# coding conventions.  Maintain consistent indentation and naming conventions.  Private variables should use the "_" prefix (e.g., `_myVariable`).

This structure groups related files logically, clarifies dependencies, simplifies maintenance, and follows Unity best practices. Assembly Definition files manage dependencies.  The `PCSS.Core.asmdef` file must include a reference to `nadena.dev.ndmf` for proper AutoFix resistance.  As of 2025-04-04, the folder structure was updated to improve clarity and maintainability.  The `PCSS.Core.asmdef` file needs to be checked for correct references to resolve compilation errors in `PCSSLightInstaller.cs` (2025-04-04).  The `PCSS.Core.asmdef` file now includes the necessary references to resolve compilation errors in `PCSSLightInstaller.cs`.  The `nadena.dev.ndmf` package was removed on 2025-04-04 and its references were removed from `PCSS.Core.asmdef`.
